We find that the $U(1)_{A}$ anomaly exists also in the discretized\ntheory as a result of an unbalance of the number of the fermions proportional\nto the Euler characteristics of the polyhedra. We then study this model by\nusing the numerical Monte-Carlo simulation. We propose a novel phase-quench\nmethod called \"anomaly-phase-quenched approximation\" with respect to the\n$U(1)_A$ anomaly. We numerically show that the Ward-Takahashi (WT) identity\nassociated with the remaining supersymmetry is realized by adopting this\napproximation.

We also show that the divergent\nbehavior of the scalar one-point function gets milder as the genus of the\nbackground increases.

We define a performance objective of $1$~mK residual RMS after\nmodeling foreground subtraction from a fiducial temperature spectrum using a\nfive-term polynomial. Most of the calibration uncertainties yield residuals of\n$1$~mK or less at $95\\%$ confidence. However, current uncertainties in the\nantenna and receiver reflection coefficients can lead to residuals of up to\n$20$ mK even in low-foreground sky regions. These dominant residuals could be\nreduced by 1) improving the accuracy in reflection measurements, especially\ntheir phase 2) improving the impedance match at the antenna-receiver interface,\nand 3) decreasing the changes with frequency of the antenna reflection phase.","arxiv_id":"1602.08065","authors":["Monsalve Raul A.","Rogers Alan E.

However, the processes of how DNA changes are produced and\nhow they accumulate in somatic cells are not clear. DNA changes include two\ntypes: point DNA mutations and chromosome changes. However, point DNA mutations\n(DNA mutations) are the main type of DNA changes that can remain and accumulate\nin cells. Severe DNA injuries are the causes for DNA mutations. However,\nMisrepair of DNA is an essential process for transforming a DNA injury into a\nsurvivable and inheritable DNA mutation. In somatic cells, Misrepair of DNA is\nthe main source of DNA mutations. Since the surviving chance of a cell by\nMisrepair of DNA is low, accumulation of DNA mutations can take place only\npossibly in the cells that can proliferate. Tumors can only develop in the\ntissues that are regenerable. The accumulation of Misrepairs of DNA needs to\nproceed in many generations of cells, and cell transformation from a normal\ncell into a tumor cell is a slow and long process. However, once a cell is\ntransformed especially when it is malignantly transformed, the deficiency of\nDNA repair and the rapid cell proliferation will accelerate the accumulation of\nDNA mutations. The process of accumulation of DNA mutations is actually the\nprocess of aging of a genome DNA. Repeated cell injuries and repeated cell\nregenerations are the two preconditions for tumor-development. For cancer\nprevention, a moderate and flexible living style is advised.","arxiv_id":"1505.01375","authors":["Wang-Michelitsch Jicun","Michelitsch Thomas M."],"categories":["q-bio.TO"],"created":"2015-05-06 00:00:00","doi":null,"primary_category":"q-bio","title":"Cell transformation in tumor-development: a result of accumulation of\n  Misrepairs of DNA through many generations of cells","updated":1483488000000},"8469":{"abstract":"Fast radio bursts are astronomical radio flashes of unknown physical nature\nwith durations of milliseconds. Their dispersive arrival times suggest an\nextragalactic origin and imply radio luminosities orders of magnitude larger\nthan any other kind of known short-duration radio transient. Thus far, all FRBs\nhave been detected with large single-dish telescopes with arcminute\nlocalizations, and attempts to identify their counterparts (source or host\ngalaxy) have relied on contemporaneous variability of field sources or the\npresence of peculiar field stars or galaxies. These attempts have not resulted\nin an unambiguous association with a host or multi-wavelength counterpart. Here\nwe report the sub-arcsecond localization of FRB 121102, the only known\nrepeating burst source, using high-time-resolution radio interferometric\nobservations that directly image the bursts themselves. Our precise\nlocalization reveals that FRB 121102 originates within 100 mas of a faint 180\nuJy persistent radio source with a continuum spectrum that is consistent with\nnon-thermal emission, and a faint (25th magnitude) optical counterpart. The\nflux density of the persistent radio source varies by tens of percent on day\ntimescales, and very long baseline radio interferometry yields an angular size\nless than 1.7 mas. Our observations are inconsistent with the fast radio burst\nhaving a Galactic origin or its source being located within a prominent\nstar-forming galaxy. Instead, the source appears to be co-located with a\nlow-luminosity active galactic nucleus or a previously unknown type of\nextragalactic source. [Truncated] If other fast radio bursts have similarly\nfaint radio and optical counterparts, our findings imply that direct\nsub-arcsecond localizations of FRBs may be the only way to provide reliable\nassociations.","arxiv_id":"1701.01098","authors":["Chatterjee S.","Law C.

We use five lines of sight inside the northern Fermi\nBubble to constrain the velocity and column densities of outflowing gas traced\nby O I, Al II, C II, C IV, Si II, Si III, Si IV and other species. All five\nlines of sight inside the northern Fermi Bubble exhibit blueshifted high\nvelocity absorption components, whereas only 9 out of the 42 lines of sight\noutside the northern Fermi Bubble exhibit blueshifted high velocity absorption\ncomponents. The observed outflow velocity profile decreases with Galactic\nlatitude and radial distance (R) from the Galactic Center. The observed\nblueshifted velocities change from $v_{GSR}$=-265 km\/s at R~2.3 kpc to\n$v_{GSR}$=-91 km\/s at R~6.5 kpc. We derive the metallicity of the entrained gas\nalong the 1H1613-097 sightline, which passes through the center of the northern\nFermi Bubble, finding [O\/H] $\\gtrsim -0.54 \\pm 0.15$. A simple kinematic model\ntuned to match the observed absorption component velocities along the five\nlines of sight inside the Bubble, constrains the outflow velocities to\n~1000$-$1300 km\/s, and the age of the outflow to be ~ 6$-$9 Myr.

Combining the age and mass outflow rates, we determine a\nminimum mass of total UV absorbing cool gas entrained in the Fermi Bubbles to\nbe $\\gtrsim \\rm{ 2 \\times 10^{6} M_{\\odot}}$.","arxiv_id":"1612.01578","authors":["Bordoloi Rongmon","Fox Andrew J.","Lockman Felix J.","Wakker Bart P.","Jenkins Edward B.","Savage Blair D.","Hernandez Svea","Tumlinson Jason","Bland-Hawthorn Joss","Kim Tae-Sun"],"categories":["astro-ph.GA"],"created":"2016-12-05 00:00:00","doi":"10.3847\/1538-4357\/834\/2\/191","primary_category":"physics","title":"Nuclear Outflow of the Milky Way: Studying the Kinematics and Spatial\n  Extent of the Northern Fermi Bubble","updated":" "},"5300":{"abstract":"We present a theory of bilayer two-dimensional electron systems that host a\nspatially indirect exciton condensate when in thermal equilibrium.

We found that the position error\naveraged over a pointing observation can be largely reduced by using the\nrelation between the deviation of the source position in the DETX direction and\nthe ecliptic latitude of the pointing target. We parameterized the wobbling of\nthe source position synchronized with the satellite orbital period with\ntemperatures of onboard radiators and elapsed time since the night-day\ntransition of the spacecraft. We developed software, aeattcor, to correct the\nimage drift using these parameters, and applied it to 27 point-source images.\nWe show that the radius of the 90% error circle of the source position was\nreduced to 19 arcsec and the PSF was sharpened. These improvements have\nenhanced the scientific capability of the Suzaku XIS.","arxiv_id":"0803.3418","authors":["Uchiyama Yasunobu","Maeda Yoshitomo","Ebara Masatoshi","Fujimoto Ryuichi","Ishisaki Yoshitaka","Ishida Manabu","Iizuka Ryo","Ushio Masayoshi","Inoue Hirohiko","Okada Shunsaku","Mori Hideyuki","Ozaki Masanobu"],"categories":["astro-ph"],"created":"2008-03-24 00:00:00","doi":"10.1093\/pasj\/60.sp1.S35","primary_category":"physics","title":"Restoring the Suzaku Source Position Accuracy and Point-Spread Function","updated":" "},"7415":{"abstract":"The magnetic geometry of the surface magnetic fields of more than 55 cool\nstars have now been mapped using spectropolarimetry.

Moreover, our answer is\ncompletely machine-independent and based over a standard notion in the theory\nof lambda-calculus: the length of a leftmost-outermost derivation to normal\nform is an invariant cost model. Such a theorem cannot be proved by directly\nrelating lambda-calculus with Turing machines or random access machines,\nbecause of the size explosion problem: there are terms that in a linear number\nof steps produce an exponentially long output. The first step towards the\nsolution is to shift to a notion of evaluation for which the length and the\nsize of the output are linearly related. This is done by adopting the linear\nsubstitution calculus (LSC), a calculus of explicit substitutions modeled after\nlinear logic proof nets and admitting a decomposition of leftmost-outermost\nderivations with the desired property. Thus, the LSC is invariant with respect\nto, say, random access machines. The second step is to show that LSC is\ninvariant with respect to the lambda-calculus. The size explosion problem seems\nto imply that this is not possible: having the same notions of normal form,\nevaluation in the LSC is exponentially longer than in the lambda-calculus. We\nsolve such an impasse by introducing a new form of shared normal form and\nshared reduction, deemed useful. Useful evaluation avoids those steps that only\nunshare the output without contributing to beta-redexes, i.e. the steps that\ncause the blow-up in size. The main technical contribution of the paper is\nindeed the definition of useful reductions and the thorough analysis of their\nproperties.","arxiv_id":"1601.01233","authors":["Accattoli Beniamino","Lago Ugo Dal"],"categories":["cs.PL","cs.LO"],"created":"2016-01-06 00:00:00","doi":"10.2168\/LMCS-12(1:4)2016","primary_category":"cs","title":"(Leftmost-Outermost) Beta Reduction is Invariant, Indeed","updated":1457395200000},"5806":{"abstract":"We study the constraints implied by partial wave unitarity on new physics in\nthe form of spin-zero di-boson resonances at LHC.

However, imperfect CSI, due to channel estimation error, imperfect\nCSI feedback and time selectivity of the channel, lead to a performance loss.\nIn this work, we propose a novel limited feedback algorithm for single-input\nsingle-output interference alignment in time-variant channels. The feedback\nalgorithm encodes the channel evolution in a small number of subspace\ncoefficients, which allow for reduced-rank channel prediction to compensate for\nthe channel estimation error due to time selectivity of the fading process and\nfeedback delay. An upper bound for the rate loss caused by feedback\nquantization and channel prediction is derived. Based on this bound, we develop\na dimension switching algorithm for the reduced-rank predictor to find the best\ntradeoff between quantization- and prediction-error. Besides, we characterize\nthe scaling of the required number of feedback bits in order to decouple the\nrate loss due to channel quantization from the transmit power.

Furthermore, we prove that\n$4$-swaps are sufficient when $F$ does not contain a matching of size $3.$ We\nextend the Curveball algorithm of Strona et al. \\cite{Strona2014b} to our\ncases.","arxiv_id":"1608.03177","authors":["Berger Annabell"],"categories":["math.CO"],"created":"2016-08-10 00:00:00","doi":null,"primary_category":"math","title":"Sampling bipartite graphs with given vertex degrees and fixed edges and\n  non-edges","updated":1484524800000},"2063":{"abstract":"We give a description of the weighted Reed-Muller codes over a prime field in\na modular algebra.

We consider\ncorrelated binary sources where the data is encoded independently at each\nsource through a systematic LDPC encoder and sent over two independent\nchannels. At the receiver, a iterative joint decoder consisting of two\ncomponent LDPC decoders is considered where the encoded bits at the output of\neach component decoder are used at the other decoder as the a priori\ninformation. We first provide asymptotic performance analysis using the concept\nof extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts. Compared to the conventional\nEXIT charts devised to analyze LDPC codes for point to point communication, the\nproposed EXIT charts have been completely modified to able to accommodate the\nsystematic nature of the codes as well as the iterative behavior between the\ntwo component decoders. Then the developed modified EXIT charts are deployed to\ndesign ensembles for different levels of correlation. Our results show that as\nthe average degree of the designed ensembles grow, the thresholds corresponding\nto the designed ensembles approach the capacity. In particular, for ensembles\nwith average degree of around 9, the gap to capacity is reduced to about 0.2dB.\nFinite block length performance evaluation is also provided for the designed\nensembles to verify the asymptotic results.","arxiv_id":"1701.08067","authors":["Mohamadi Mohamad Khas","Saeedi Hamid","Asvadi Reza"],"categories":["cs.IT","math.IT"],"created":"2017-01-27 00:00:00","doi":null,"primary_category":"math","title":"Design of Capacity Approaching Ensembles of LDPC Codes for Correlated\n  Sources using EXIT Charts","updated":" "},"5966":{"abstract":"The freezeout conditions in proton-proton collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\textrm{NN}}}= 200$, $900$ and $7000$ GeV have been extracted by fits\nto the mean hadron yields at mid-rapidity within the framework of the\nstatistical model of an ideal gas of hadrons and resonances in the grand\ncanonical ensemble.
